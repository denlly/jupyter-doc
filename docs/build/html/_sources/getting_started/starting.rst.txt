Starting JupyterLab
-------------------

Start JupyterLab using:

.. code:: bash

    jupyter lab

JupyterLab will open automatically in your browser.

You may access JupyterLab by entering the notebook server's :ref:`URL <urls>`
into the browser. JupyterLab sessions always reside in a
:ref:`workspace <url-workspaces>`. The default workspace is the main ``/lab`` URL:

.. code-block:: none

  http(s)://<server:port>/<lab-location>/lab

Because JupyterLab is a server extension of the classic Jupyter Notebook
server, you can launch JupyterLab by calling ``jupyter notebook``
and visiting the ``/lab`` URL.

Like the classic notebook,
JupyterLab provides a way for users to copy URLs that
:ref:`open a specific notebook or file <url-tree>`. Additionally,
JupyterLab URLs are an advanced part of the user interface that allows for
managing :ref:`workspaces <url-workspaces>`. To learn more about URLs in
Jupyterlab, visit :ref:`urls`.

To open the classic Notebook from JupyterLab, select "Launch Classic Notebook"
from the JupyterLab Help menu, or you can change the URL
from ``/lab`` to ``/tree``.

JupyterLab has the same security model as the classic Jupyter Notebook;
for more information see the `security
section <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security.html>`__
of the classic Notebook's documentation.
